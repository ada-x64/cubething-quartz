This is a fork of [Quartz v4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).
I've set up automatic syncing of content from a submodule. The contents of that submodule are private, but this repo is public! (It would be private if I wanted to pay for hosting.)

I use Obsidian to handle my notes, and since I develop on WSL2, and Obsidian can't handle WSL2 links, I needed a submodule.
